## About Me

I am a problem solver and AI researcher passionate about developing innovative solutions at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and full-stack development. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at New York University, I bring a strong foundation in research, software engineering, and entrepreneurship.

## Research Interests & Expertise

My research focuses on **Explainable AI (XAI)**, **Fairness in Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** applications. I have published 3 IEEE conference papers as first author, with research spanning:

- **UAV/Drone Classification** - Developed lightweight CNN architectures with Defense Institute of Advanced Technology, achieving 5× reduction in computational complexity while improving accuracy by 5%
- **Human Activity Recognition** - Applied Shapley value-based game theory for feature contribution analysis across 500+ sensor attributes
- **Fair AI Systems** - Implemented fairness-aware techniques reducing demographic bias by 30% while maintaining model performance
- **Explainable AI** - Extensive work with SHAP and LIME for model interpretability in healthcare and wearable device applications
