{: .notice--info}

- Researched with **Defence Institute of Advanced Technology** to develop a novel lightweight CNN architecture for UAV/Drone identification and classification. Independently designed Cross Stage Partial Network reducing computational complexity **5×**, inference time **20×**, and FLOPs **5×** while improving accuracy by **5%** and reducing model size by **7 times**
- Implemented **Shapley value-based game theory approach** for feature contribution analysis across **500+ sensor attributes** in wearable device applications, enhancing model transparency and interpretability for human activity recognition systems
- Conducted research on **Explainable AI** using SHAP and LIME techniques to interpret deep learning models, ensuring fairness and bias mitigation in machine learning predictions
- Investigated fairness metrics including **Statistical Parity Difference (SPD)**, **Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD)**, and **Theil Index (TI)** to assess and improve model fairness across demographic groups
