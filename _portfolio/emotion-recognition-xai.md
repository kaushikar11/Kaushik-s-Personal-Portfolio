## Overview
Designed GRU-based emotion classification system for multi-class emotion recognition using physiological biosignals including ECG (electrocardiogram), EMG (electromyography), GSR (galvanic skin response), respiration rate, and BVP (blood volume pulse), achieving **95% classification accuracy**.

## Key Contributions
- Implemented **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** and **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** for comprehensive feature contribution analysis
- Conducted comparative feature importance analysis across ECG, EMG, GSR, respiration, and BVP signals using Shapley value calculations and game theory-based approaches
- Implemented fair ML strategies including **Learning Fair Representations (LFR)**, **Disparate Impact Remover (DIR)**, and **Reweighing techniques** to systematically reduce demographic bias by **30%** while maintaining high classification performance
- Investigated fairness and bias using multiple evaluation metrics including **Statistical Parity Difference (SPD)**, **Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD)**, and **Theil Index (TI)**
- Enhanced model transparency by providing explainable predictions with visual feature attribution maps
